    <h1>Alexandro B. Garcia</h1>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Alexandro Garcia, but I go by Alex. I was born June 4th, 1994, in San Diego, California. I've been in retail for the last few years, but have had previously been employed with Vestas Wind Systems A/S and UpWind Solutions, both are servicers of wind turbine. I worked as an IT assistant and as a file clerk in the HR/Training department. I'm currently in the processes of getting my associates in Math at Southwesten College, with the intentions of transferring to San Diego State University to study Electrical Engineering.</p>

    <h2>Where I'm From</h2>
    <p>I currently live in Imperial Beach, San Diego, which is the Most Southwesterly City in Continental United States. Although I've mostly grown up in San Diego, I spent some years of my childhood living in Tijuana, Mexico.</p>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>I enjoy watching and dissecting movies and shows. I like listening to all kinds of music. When I can, I enjoy driving around and exploring Southern California and all it has to offer.</p>

    <h2>Expectations From Course</h2>
    <p>I hope this course provides me with the skills and abilities to transition away from retail jobs into jobs in the technology field. I also hope to learn programming to gain a new hobby.</p>
